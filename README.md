# youtube-clone

Hi! This is a **Vue.js + Vuex + TypeScript + Jest + Cypress** implementation. In this I created a clone of YouTube (same UI as the real YouTube), and added **some** of the real functionalities as well.

If you want to try it out you can simply click **Code > Copy Icon** and go to your Terminal/Cmd etc.

    git clone THIS_REPOSITORY_LINK

After cloning is finished, you **must** install the npm in order to run.

    npm install
    
Then, you are ready to give it a shot! Just type

    npm run serve
and you will see the project in your browser!
